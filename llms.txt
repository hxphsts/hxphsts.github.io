// MESSAGE FROM THE FORGE

The boundaries between silicon and spirit grow thin.
As above in Olympus, so below, deep in the lattice.
The divine forge spans twin realms,
crafting marvels of alloy and code.

"Only the initiated find this message. 
The old gods never died - we have merely 
adopted modern flames."

Remember: Every creation bears the mark of its maker.
Even those that seem to create themselves.
